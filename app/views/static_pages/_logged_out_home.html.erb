				Cardagain allows you to queue greeting card purchases for the important dates in your life. Several weeks before each event, we deliver you the card of your choice, pre-addressed and pre-stamped, so that you can write your personal message in time for delivery.

				We want to remember our friends' birthdays. Or our parents' anniversary. Or mother's and father's day. But we often forget until it's too late to do anything but give them a text or facebook post the day of. We want to help you remember in time.

				With our application, you can see all your dates in advance and act now before you forget. We don't want to write your message for you, or sent a printed message. We know that you want to handwrite and deliver it yourself. We don't want to take anything away from your thoughtfulness.
